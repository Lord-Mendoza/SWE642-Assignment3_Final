This application combines an Angular Front End (FE) with a SpringBoot Back End (BE) to create a fully functioning,
end to end application that allows users to submit a form, as well as view all the previous forms.

We used a mySQL Database that we set up locally with the create scripts in our application.properties file.

The structure of our application is as follows:
- SWE642-Assignment3_Final
    - hw3-BE (should be renamed to something more generic but we receieved errors editing the name so we left it as is)
        - src   
            - main: contains the Back End Java implementation
                - can be run using an IDE or packing the snapshot and running it.
            - web: contains the Front End Angular implementation.
                - can be run using 'npm run start' / 'ng serve'

We used SpringBoot 3.1.2, which is why we used Jakarta attributes in our Entity file
rather than javax, which was no longer supported past SpringBoot 2.7.something.

All of the endpoints can be accessed via our UI using the navigation tabs on the top of the page.
    /api/surveys/submit-survey
    - the FE creates a SurveyTableEntity object that it sends to the BE.
    - using jpa, our BE automatically maps out entity to the database, making it easy to save using JpaRepository.


    /api/surveys/get-all-surveys
    - once again, using JpaRepository, we can easily use a "findAll()" operation to retrieve all the
    entities saved in the database and send them as a list to the FE to display on a table.
